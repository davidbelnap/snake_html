By default, the "snake" has an X velocity of 1. This is so that it can print "GAME OVER" to the console anytime the front end of the "snake" instersects with itself. Otherwise, it would print "GAME OVER" non-stop until you start moving.
You can change this simply by commenting out lines 13 and 39 and uncommenting line 12. It will then start at a velocity of 0 and will not console.log("GAME OVER").
